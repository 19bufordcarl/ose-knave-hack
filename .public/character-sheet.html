# Header
The Character sheet header contains text fields you can edit directly. There is no automation done with those fields and you will have to type them manually in most cases.

The greyed text on top of the experience field is the XP prime requisites bonus that can be set in the Tweaks dialog (see below). It is used when experience is dealt automatically via the party sheet.

Note that the Level will have a flash animation as soon as the character has enough experience to level up. This experience threshold is set in the Tweaks dialog.

# Attributes Tab
![image](uploads/bdb095faaa5fadd011accd200b56c5d1/image.png)

The Default tab is dedicated to the statistics of the actor. On the left you will find the attribute scores. You can edit those values directly.

Rolls can be made by clicking on the attribute name. After clicking you will see a dialog where you can input modifiers. If you try to roll the attributes will holding the CTRL key, the dialog will be skipped.

Above the attributes you can click on the book icon to see the influence of all the attributes on the other stats of your character. That will be really useful during character creation, but also to see other stats like your maximum number of retainers, or literacy

In the middle you will find on the first row.
- Editable HP values, the 'bucket' will empty as you lose HPs.

- An Armor class within a shield shape. The value above is the AC and below will be the unarmored armor class. It's calculated depending on the armor you have equipped. You can add an armor bonus in the Tweaks dialog. 

If there is a small shield icon on top of the Armor class value, it means you have a shield equipped that should not be taken into account when you are attacked from behind.

Within the second row you will have an Hit Dice field you can roll for obscure reasons, and if the individual initiative is set in the Settings, you will see the initiative value. This value is calculated but you can add a modifier in the Tweaks dialog.

The third row details the Attack statistics. It will change if you have the Ascending AC setting enabled.
At the center you will find the THAC0, on the left the Melee attack modifier that is influenced by strength and on the right the Missile modifier influenced by Dexterity. you can hover both to have the details of the calculation, and add a bonus if needed in the Tweaks dialog.
Both field names are clickable and will roll attacks that can be speedrolled by maintaining the CTRL key.

The first shows the movement stats that are computed automatically by default, depending on the weight you are carrying (See the inventory section).

# Abilities Tab

The first row contains rollable entries for exploration rolls. Can be speed rolled as well.
In the abilities section you can create anything that needs a description. It can be thieves skills, class abilities, and so on. You can create a new ability by clicking the plus button or by dragging from the item sidebar or a compendium.
You can open the abilities with the pen icon, show it in the chat with the eye icon, and delete it with the trash icon. 

When opened, the ability details can be entered. On the left you see you can set the ability requirements, for example `Thief, 1`, you can enter a roll associated with the ability. 
For example if Roll is `1d100`, roll type is `>=` and target is `40`. The roll will display success in green as soon as the result is above 40.
When the ability has a roll set you can click on the ability image on the character sheet to roll directly to the chat.

If you need someone else to roll the ability you can show the whole ability to the chat with the eye icon and they can roll from there. 

Note that you can slide down the ability description by clicking on its name from the character sheet.

# Spells Tab

You won't have this tab displayed by default. You must enable the `spellcaster` checkbox in the Tweaks dialog located in the sheet toolbar.
Here you can record your spellbook content. First you can add a new spell by clicking the plus. For each level of spell you have you will have a new section for its level with it's related spell slot counter. 
At the beginning I recommend creating one New Spell for each spell level you have and then change their level by opening them, it will unblock the spell slot counters.

Spell slots counters have two values. The first one is the number of spells you have memorized, it can't be edited. And the second one is the total number of spell slots you have. You should edit those as you gain new levels.

Spells are similar with abilities but have a few more infos. Rolls can't be configured as well, you can only set a roll string that respects Foundry VTT syntax.
However you can specify a Save so when the Spell is displayed on chat with the eye icon, a button that triggers a save roll from the selected actors is displayed below the spell description.

Spells themselves have counters. The first is the remaining available spells, the second is the number of this spell you memorized.
The spell counter decreases as you roll them by clicking their image.
