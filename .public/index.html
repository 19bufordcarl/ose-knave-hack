        <h4>Setup</h4>
        <p>You can find System settings in the Configure Settings dialog you
          open from the sidebar</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="./images/settings.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          These are several settings to customize your experience with Old
          School Essentials.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Individual initiative</strong>:The default behavior for
              initiative is to have only one roll per faction. This will come
              back to Foundry VTT
              default behavior, and show the initiative field on character
              sheets, see the <a href="#attributes">Attributes</a> section.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ascending Armor Class</strong>:Old School Essentials
              default option is to use the original descending Armor Class and
              the 'To Hit AC 0' attack statistic alias THAC0.
              If this input is checked, this will come back to the familiar
              Attack Bonus as well as an Ascending Armor Class.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Morale Rating</strong>: This will show a Morale Field in
              the Monster sheet so you can record and roll a Morale check to see
              wether your monster has a survival instinct or will fight till the
              end.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Variable weapon damage</strong>:By default, even if the
              damage field is shown in the weapons sheets, the rolled damage
              will always be a d6, except for monsters. With this enabled, the
              damage displayed will be effectively used for characters.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Encumbrance</strong>:The weight a character is carrying
              is a significant part of the players treasure hunting adventures.
              You have three options here.
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Disabled</strong>: You can disable the effect of
                  weight on movement, it will still be calculated.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic</strong>: This will add only the weight of
                  your treasure, and take into account the armor you're wearing
                  to find your movement rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Detailed</strong>: All the weight you carry will be
                  counted, your movement value depends on the fraction of your
                  max encumbrance you carry.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Significant treasure weight</strong>: If you have the
              Basic encumbrance option enabled, the movement rate will depend on
              a predefined weight at which you consider the treasure to be
              cumbersome. You can set the value here and it will be used to
              determine the movement rates of characters.

                <li><strong>Armor Class</strong>: This value will be added
                  (ascending) or subtracted (default) to the Armor class value
                  that initially depends on the armor you wear and your
                  Dexterity modifier.</li>
                <li><strong>Encumbrance</strong> (GM Only): The maximum value at
                  which you can't move anymore. If you have an encumbrance of
                  1800 it will delay any movement penalty by 200 (1800-1600).</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate movement</strong> (GM Only): if you have a

            </p>
            <p>The Character sheet header contains text fields you can edit
              directly. There is no automation done with those fields and you
              will
              have to type them manually in most cases.</p>
            <p>The greyed text on top of the experience field is the XP prime
              requisites bonus that can be
              set in the Tweaks dialog (see below). It is used when experience
              is
              dealt automatically via the party sheet.</p>
            <p> If the character survives long enough, the Level field will
              have a flash animation as soon when the character got enough
              experience to level up. This experience threshold is set in the
              Tweaks dialog.
            </p>

            <p>This records the attribute scores. You can edit those
              values directly.</p>
            <p>Rolls can be made by clicking on the attribute name, after
              clicking you will see a dialog where you can input modifiers. If
              you try to roll the attributes will holding the CTRL key, the
              dialog will be skipped.</p>

            <p>Above the attributes you can click on the book icon to see the
              influence of all the attributes on the other stats of your
              character. That will be useful during character creation, but also
              to see other stats like your maximum number of retainers, or
              literacy.</p>

              Hit points current and max values: the 'bucket' will empty as
              you lose HPs.
            </p>
            <p>
              An Armor class within a shield shape: The value above is the
              AC and below will be the unarmored armor class. It's
              calculated depending on the armor you have equipped. You can
              add an armor bonus in the Tweaks dialog.
              If there is a small shield icon on top of the Armor class
              value, it means you have a shield equipped that should not be
              taken into account when you are attacked from behind.
            </p>
            <p>On the second row there is a Hit Dice field you can roll, and if
              the individual initiative is set in the Settings, there is the
              initiative value. This value is calculated but you can add a
              modifier in the Tweaks dialog.</p>
            <p>The third row details the Attack statistics. It will change if
              you have the Ascending AC setting enabled. At the center you will
              find the THAC0 or Attack Bonus (AB), on the left the Melee attack
              modifier that is influenced by strength and on the right the
              Missile modifier influenced by Dexterity. you can hover both to
              have the details of the calculation, and add a bonus if needed in
              the Tweaks dialog.
              Both field names are clickable and will roll attacks that can be
              speedrolled by maintaining the CTRL key.

            </p>
            <p>
              The last row shows the three movement stats, they are
              automagically set by default, depending on the weight you are
              carrying and the encumbrance options (See the <a
                href="#inventory">inventory</a> section).
              You can disable this behavior through the <a href="#tweaks">Tweaks</a>
              dialog.

            <h4 class="docs-header">Right</h4>
            <p>
              Here are recorder the saving throw scores. Complete names and
              abbreviations can be seen on hover. This can be rolled when the
              save name is clicked, and can be speedrolled with CTRL as well.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/save-roll.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              The last value for Bonus versus magic must be manually added to
              the roll by using the dialog that pops without speedrolling.
            </p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Abilities</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/abilities.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              The first row contains rollable entries for exploration rolls.
              Those can be speed rolled as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the abilities section you can create anything that needs a
              description. It can be thieves skills, class abilities, and so on.
              You can create a new ability by clicking the plus button or by
              dragging one from the item sidebar or a compendium.
              You can open the abilities with the pen icon, show it in the chat
              with the eye icon, and delete it with the trash icon.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/ability.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              When opened, the ability details can be entered. On the left you
              see you can set the ability requirements, for example `Thief, 1`,
              you can enter a roll associated with the ability.
              For example if Roll is `1d100`, roll type is `>=` and target is
              `40`. The roll will display success in green as soon as the result
              is above 40.
              When the ability has a roll set you can click on the ability image
              on the character sheet to roll directly to the chat.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/ability-chat.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              If you need someone else to roll the ability you can show the
              whole ability to the chat with the eye icon and they can roll from
              there.
              Note that you can slide down the ability description by clicking
              on its name from the character sheet.
            </p>
            <h4 class="docs-header">Spells</h4>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/spells.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              You won't have this tab displayed by default. You must enable the
              `spellcaster` checkbox in the Tweaks dialog located in the sheet
              toolbar.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here you can record your spellbook content. First you can add a
              new spell by clicking the plus. For each level of spell you have
              you will have a new section for its level with it's related spell
              slot counter.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the beginning I recommend creating one New Spell for each spell
              level you have and then change their level by opening them, it
              will unblock the spell slot counters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spell slots counters have two values. The first one is the number
              of spells you have memorized, it can't be edited. And the second
              one is the total number of spell slots you have. You should edit
              those as you gain new levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spells themselves have counters. The first is the remaining
              available spells, the second is the number of this spell you
              memorized.
              The spell counter decreases as you roll them by clicking their
              image. Spell slots that have been used can all be refilled by clicking the reset icon in the spells tab header.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/spell.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
              Spells are similar with abilities but have a few more infos. Rolls
              can't be configured as much, you can only set a roll string that
              respects Foundry VTT syntax.
              However you can specify a Save so when the Spell is displayed on
              chat with the eye icon, a button that triggers a save roll from
              the selected actors is displayed below the spell description.
            </p>

              The inventory compiles every item you own from the weapon to the treasure. Weapons are in the first section. Clicking on the weapon icon will roll an attack with damage.
